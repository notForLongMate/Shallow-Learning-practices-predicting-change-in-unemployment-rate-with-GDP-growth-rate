Just Unemployment-rate Prediction Analysis System (JUPAS)

This project is my ENGG1003 course final individual project. It is mainly about how I programed a machine learning model to predict the % change in unemployment rate with GDP growth rate as input (according to Okun's Law they have negative relationship)
The data used to train the model is from Hong Kong (https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=210-06401&f & https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=310-30001&full_series=1&download_csv=1#) with further cleansing and modification, so it may not be suitable to predict datas in your region or country. But you may try to change the data to see if it fits.
A more detailed explaination will be provided in the markdowns in the .ipynb file, you may refer to it if you want to know more about the machanism of the models.
For beginner: Sorry I am also a newbie to machine learning so I may not be able to answer your questions (though I will try my best to do so), but I left some youtube playlist which I think is really useful in the reference part of my project.
For pros: Sorry I am a non cs major who want to build something cool, if you found that is too amateur or containes too many bugs, please let me know how can it be improved <3.

Installation:
1. For beginner, you may simply download the .zip file after pressing the greed "<>code" button.
   for Pros, you may try "git clone https://github.com/notForLongMate/Shallow-Learning-practices-predicting-change-in-unemployment-rate-with-GDP-growth-rate.git" in Git Bash, ig?

2. Open the project.ipynb with suitable tools like vs code or jupyter notebook.

3. change the direction of the data to the directory where "ProcessedData.csv" is.

4. Enjoy the program

If you got any question and comments, feel free to leave it here so I can further improve my program or discuss with u!
